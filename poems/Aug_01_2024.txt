In a village, where time meanders slow,  
Under the skies, where dreams tend to grow,  
A tale unfolds on the cobbled street,  
Where futures are drawn with hands discrete.  

With oiled plans, finely laid and sleek,  
Guiding the strong and supporting the weak,  
A craftsman with visions broad and grand,  
Sketches his dreams with a steady hand.  

On surfaces rough, with lines of chalk,  
He outlines paths where destinies walk.  
A master of fate, in a world so bleak,  
He whispers to hearts too scared to speak.  

In every stroke, a promise is bound,  
In every color, new hope is found.  
Through chalk-drawn dreams, he dares to plant,  
Seeds of tomorrow, in souls that chant.  

For in his world, built on canvas bare,  
Lies the power to craft from thin air,  
A realm where every drawn line starts,  
To shape the future, in all our hearts.  

So let these oiled plans in chalk persist,  
Through storms that rage and mists that twist.  
For in this quaint village, under this sky,  
Lies the key to dream, to do, to defy.
