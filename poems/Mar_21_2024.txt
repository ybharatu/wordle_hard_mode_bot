In the shade of the ancient Serra, where whispers wind,
Among shadows that stale, unkind,
Echoes of old, in corners confined,
There shapes a tale, in the mind's bind.

In the quiet, where light and dark entwined,
A silhouette, a form unrefined,
Beneath the Serra, under its watchful eyes,
Lies a story, where truth and fiction vie.

The shape of things once bright,
Now touched by time, a stale blight,
Yet in this dimming, in the encroaching shade,
Lives beauty, in decay's parade.

The Serra knows, it understands,
That life is but shapes in sands,
Ephemeral, yet eternally engraved,
In the shade of memory, bravely braved.

So let us walk the Serra's path,
Where each step a story, each sigh a bath,
In the stale air, find the shape anew,
For in the shadow, lies a light most true.
