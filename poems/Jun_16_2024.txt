In the relay of generations, a baton passed,
From hand to trembling hand, in haste contrast.
A journey not of solitude, but shared in trois,
Three souls intertwined, their spirits rejoice.

Beneath their feet, the ancient brick did lay,
A testament to those who walked this way.
Each one placed with purpose, strength, and find,
A foundation firm, against the sands of time.

As seasons turned, their wills did grind,
Against the trials that life assigned.
Yet, in this struggle, a beauty refined,
In the crucible of dreams, their fates aligned.

Through streets that echo with tales of yore,
Their steps a dance, a ceaseless chore.
Though the weight of legacy heavy draws,
They carry on, for a cause that thaws.

The relay, a journey of heart and mind,
Where past and future are intertwined.
Upon this path, they seek and bind,
The essence of hope, for all mankind.
