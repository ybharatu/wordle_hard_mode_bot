Beneath the veil of twilight's mien,
Where shadows cling and sights unseen,
Lay the lands of whispered lore,
Beyond our grasp, evermore.

In this realm, where time holds no sway,
A crony of Night, in silence lay.
Whispering secrets, old as the moon,
Crafting destinies with a silent tune.

Yet in this ethereal, timeless nook,
Lies a poison, in the brook.
A toxin, subtle, with no name,
Tampering with life's fragile frame.

Its usage, shrouded in mystery deep,
A guardian's vow, forever to keep.
For in its essence, power untold,
A tale of caution, through ages old.

So tread lightly in this enchanted place,
Where time and dreams interlace.
For the toxin, with its silent plea,
Holds the key to eternity.
