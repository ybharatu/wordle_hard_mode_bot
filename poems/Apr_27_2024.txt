In a world where shadows whisper and light dares to glean,
Where clips of life's memories, both bitter and keen,
Blend into the mosaic of the mind's serene scene,
A truth blares louder than a king's decree, unseen.

It's in the gleam of the eye, where secrets hide,
In the flicker of moments, where our fears reside.
Through the clatter and clang of reality's ride,
We seek, we yearn, to turn the tide.

To glean wisdom from the pain, a treasure within,
To let the light's gleam guide us, through thick and thin.
In this journey of clips, where does one begin?
To understand the blare, the silence within?

So let us treasure each gleam, each clip, each shout,
For in this cacophony of life, we find our route.
Gleaning lessons from shadows, that's what it's about,
In the blare and the gleam, where we win our bout.
