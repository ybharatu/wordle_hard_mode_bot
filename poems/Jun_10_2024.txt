In a grove where mangy beasts dare not rove,
Among the cairns that silent guardians prove,
There blossoms, unrestrained, a solitary mango grove.

Beneath its boughs, where sunlight dares to weave,
A Plea to the heavens, fervently conceived,
In whispers of the wind, if you can believe.

Not in the shadows, but in luminescence clear,
The narrative unfolds, like manga pages, dear,
A tale not of darkness, but of hopes to persevere.

For every stone in the cairn, a story bright,
Of overcoming shadows, reaching for the light,
Each manga strip a saga, against the night.

So, in the presence of the manga and the mango tree,
Where mangy fears find solace and flee,
There the heart finds peace, and the soul is free.
