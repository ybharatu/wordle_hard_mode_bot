In the cradle of dawn, where dreams spawn,  
Beneath the sky's vast, endless brier,  
There lies a truth, quietly sworn,  
By the hands of time, gripping tighter with plier.  

These hands that mold, that shape and sculpt,  
With the precision of moments, sly and prior,  
Crafting destinies with every tumult,  
In the forge of fate, amidst fire and lyre.  

For in every beginning, marked by time's spawn,  
And with every tool, like the plier,  
There lies a path, trodden upon,  
By feet marching towards what hearts require.  

Behind each dawn, under each glowing pyre,  
Lies the echo of actions, decisions drawn,  
Guided by wisdom, older and higher,  
Leading us through night until the arrival of morn.  

So grasp the plier, face the morrow,  
For what's been sown by actions prior,  
Brings forth the fruits that time will borrow,  
In life's relentless, beautiful choir.
