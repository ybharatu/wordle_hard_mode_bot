In the quiet of the dusk, where shadows heavy heave,
Beneath the moon's soft gaze where dreamers dare believe,
A symphony began, whispered through the night,
Where stars in endless waltz twinkled oh so bright.

The wind, it carried secrets, of lovers and their trysts,
Of sailorsâ€™ licks at salty seas, under heavens amethyst.
In every gentle breeze, a story rated high,
Of victories and losses, of hellos and goodbyes.

The heart of night grew heavier, with each tale it spun,
Of moments lost and found, of battles lost and won.
Yet, in this weight of world, there came a gentle ease,
Like waves that meet the shore, just to retreat and tease.

And so, the night progressed, in its enchanting weave,
Of everything it touched, and all it would conceive.
From whispered beginnings to endings soft and brave,
In the cradle of the night, where the soul finds what it craves.

The dawn then broke, a canvas fresh and clear,
A reminder that in endings, beginnings are always near.
So we rise from dreams heavy, with hearts ready to strive,
For in the cycle of the day and night, we find we're truly alive.
