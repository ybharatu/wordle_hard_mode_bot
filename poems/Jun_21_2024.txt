In the canvas of existence, where jokes play light,  
Where laity dance, in the mirth of the night.  
Not a whisper to be heard, in the jovial crowd,  
Not a shadow to be seen, under laughter so loud.  

A stroke of faint hope, in the heartâ€™s delicate art,  
A touch of paint, in dreams that depart.  
Life sketches in colors, both somber and bright,  
In the gallery of moments, each a delightful sight.  

Jests find their hues in the spectrum of days,  
As ordinary hands in extraordinary ways.  
Craft the masterpiece, from sorrow and mirth,  
A tribute to the trials and treasures of earth.  

So here, in the symphony of the human spirit's stint,  
We find beauty, in a glimmer, a hue, a hint.  
Through laughter and pain, our stories we paint,  
A mural of memories, tender and faint.  

Thus, in the jest of life, we all partake,  
Creating a tapestry of moments, awake.  
In the palette of existence, we find our tint,  
In the art of living, unmistakably imprint.  

No need for whispers, no need for shadows to cast,  
For in the brightness of life, our colors are vast.  
Within each stroke, each line, and each faint,  
We find the essence of being, without restraint.
