In a town where the acute rains fell,
Under the grip of a sky so swell,
Lived a mayor with a curious tale,
A story that made the bravest pale.

He battled not with sword or shield,
But with words and wills that wouldn't yield.
Against a harpy, fierce and wild,
That shrieked as fierce as storms compiled.

The harpy, with eyes of ember's glow,
And wings like night without the crow,
Descended each time the rains would wane,
To remind the town of her eternal reign.

But the mayor, with wisdom old and true,
Spoke of peace in the misty dew.
He sang of unity, love, and light,
In those acute rains, against the night.

And so, in time, the harpy saw,
The beauty in the mayor's law.
From fierce to calm, she changed her mien,
Becoming a guardian, serene and keen.

Now, when the acute rains fall,
And the darkened skies begin to call,
The mayor and the harpy side by side,
Remind the town of how peace was tied.

In whispers, trees to one another say,
How acute rains washed the hate away.
And in their shade, the children play,
Dreaming of skies, not grim but gay.

So here's a tale from a town so small,
Where the mayor and the harpy, above it all,
Taught that even in the darkest of night,
There lies the potential for hope, so bright.
