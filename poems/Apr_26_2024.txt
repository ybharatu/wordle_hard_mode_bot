In the quiet of a world gone vapid,
Where colors fade and joys are sapped,
There whispers a tune, both ancient and magic,
Heard only by those whose hearts haven't napped.

A talon, sharp and glistening under the moon's glow,
Belongs to the mighty, in the night's ethereal flow.
It slices through veils of silence, so deep,
Awakening the soul from its listless sleep.

It hears the unspoken, sees the unseen,
In places where the weary have been.
A beacon of hope in the dark, so drastic,
Proving yet again, that life is fantastic.

For in a realm where the mundane dances,
And reality often blurs and prances,
Lies a truth as clear as the day,
Magic is real, in its own peculiar way.

So, let the talon guide you through the night,
Beyond whatâ€™s simple, easy, or light.
To where imagination stirs and fiercely taps,
Defying the world, deemed vapid in its traps.
