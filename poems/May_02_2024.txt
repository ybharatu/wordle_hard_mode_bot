Beneath the canopy where whispers dwell,
In lands where Pedro tales boldly swell,
A journey takes its breath, embarks, emboldens,
Woven through the tapestry that the past upholds, then

In every slice of life, every tear, every laugh,
In the transitioning shades of the epitaph,
There lies the essence, raw, unabashedly flesh,
In every struggle, in every mesh.

The tales not just of victories sung,
But of every heart, beaten, wrung,
In slices of moments, both bitter and sweet,
In the flesh of existence, every beat.

And so Pedro's story interlaces,
With every life it embraces,
A slice of the universal, in the grand design,
Flesh and spirit intertwined, divine.

There, amidst the echo of tales untold,
In the slice of the now and the days of old,
Flesh and spirit in a dance forever bold,
Pedro's tales, in every heart, take hold.
