In the heart of the storm, where whispers dwell,
A dolce note in chaos finds its way.
A focal point, amidst the tempest's swell,
Where local legends oft are wont to stray.

The gale, it roars, a fearsome, wild beast,
Yet in its core, a quiet beauty lies.
A paradox, to say the very least,
A storm that sings, beneath the troubled skies.

Here, local stories intertwine and mesh,
Tales of the land, where nature's fury reigns.
Yet in the storm, we feel anew, refresh,
As rain washes away our earthly pains.

Dolce, the calm that follows raging winds,
A focal peace, where new hope now begins.
