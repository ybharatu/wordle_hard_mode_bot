In realms where peach and devil meet,
A story unfolds in rhythm sweet. 
Below the howling winds of change,
A dance of shadows, vast and strange.

Through orchards of temptation's fruit,
Where whispers beckon, voices mute. 
Rents in time, a tear unseen,
Where past and present brightly glean.

Beneath the fiery gaze of scorn,
The devil weaves a tale forlorn. 
Yet in the depths of darkness deep,
A peach tree whispers secrets keep.

Below the earth, where roots entwine,
A balance struck, a peace divine. 
In harmony, where yin and yang,
A symphony of life's grand clang.

Title: "Whispers of the Peach Tree"
