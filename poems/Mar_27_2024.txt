In the midst of silence, tales began to shout,
Echoing through the canyons of doubt.
They whispered of heroes, they screamed of the past,
In their embrace, shadows were cast.

The air stunk of truths too long unspoken,
Of promises made, and promises broken.
Yet, in that pungent field of despair,
Hope bloomed fragrant, sweet, and fair.

For every whisper that stung the night,
Bore the weight of darkness, and the heft of light.
Pain, though sharp, led wisdom's sting,
Teaching hearts to heal, and souls to sing.

So let the tales shout, let them roar,
For within their depths lies much more.
In their echoes, find the strength to confront,
The stunk, the stung, the hunt, the hunt.
