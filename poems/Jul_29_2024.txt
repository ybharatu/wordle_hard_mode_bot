In the kingdom of the mundane, an adventure did weave,  
Amidst the echoes of silence, not a soul to grieve.  
An orb of light, a super moon, in its splendor did cleave  
The night's cloak in two, a magic ordinary folk scarcely believe.  

Within the humble abode of a commoner's reprieve,  
Lay a warrior of the morning, battles up his sleeve.  
His foe, not dragon nor sorcerer, but a strep throat's heave,  
A siege within, fevered whispers, no potions to relieve.  

Yet with steel resolve, he reached for his blade, to shave,  
A ritual, a defiance, his spirits to retrieve.  
Mirror reflecting, not just a man, but a knight, brave,  
In the small acts, the grandest courage we conceive.  

The moon still a witness, to the silent vow he gave,  
In the depths of suffering, strength he would achieve.  
A tale not of glory, but of a simple day, he'd pave,  
A testament that in the ordinary, we can weave dreams to believe.
