Beneath the weary sky, lawns stretch out,
A quilt of green, worn, threadbare in drought.
Through days long past, their vigor ebbed,
Once vibrant blades, now tired, have fled.

A weary traveler seeks solace here,
Amidst the whispering grass, his thoughts clear.
He lays a cover, frayed with time,
Upon this earth, under the sky's sublime.

In silence, he finds a cheer untold,
Within the rustling leaves, stories bold.
The lawns, in their tired embrace, still keep
Secrets of the earth, so deep.

As day gives way to the velvet night,
Stars twinkle above with unabashed light.
The lawns, under the moon's tender glow,
Whisper to the soul, softly, slow.

In this moment, fatigue finds its reprieve,
In the embrace of the earth, he believes.
For even tired lawns, under star's bright sheen,
Hold the magic of worlds, unseen.
