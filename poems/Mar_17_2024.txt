In the cadence of life, beneath twilight's dome,
Where whispers craft the essence of a rhyme,
Lies a tale of time, a rhythmic tome,
A story told in metre, beat, and chime.

Upon the path, where shadows short are cast,
And stars above in silent judgment snort,
Each traveler moves, both future and past,
In search of solace, sanctuary, or fort.

But in the dance of days, the fleeting dart,
The story breathes, a living work of art,
Where every short stride, each minor part,
Plays its role with a pulsating heart.

For isn't life but a series of beats,
A composition of victories and defeats?
In every breath, every heart that meets,
There's music in the meters, the retreats.

So let the world in stubborn snorts deride,
And let the paths be narrow, rough, and wide,
The rhythm of existence is our guide,
And in each short measure, we abide.

We find in each snort, each metre short,
The beauty of life, the last resort,
For in the cadence, we find our port,
A haven crafted, a celestial fort.
