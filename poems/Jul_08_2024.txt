In the Halls of Cruel Deans

In the halls of cruel deans, where judgment skate,
Upon icy floors of fate, they arbitrate.
With a look that could freeze midsummer's beam,
They carve out futures, so it would seem.

In this place where shame finds its relentless grip,
Among the echoes of ambition, dreams can slip.
Yet, from the grasp of scorn and cold disdain,
Emerges a will that refuses to wane.

For within the heart, a secret mold,
A strength to transform, to reshape, to hold
The essence of self, beyond critique or blame,
A sculpture of soul, no two the same.

And there, in the rink where the cruel deans glide,
Beneath their surface, true forms hide.
Not in the harshness of their judgment's skate,
But in the resilience of those who create.

From the friction of challenge, a spark does ignite,
In the shadow of power, emerges one's own light.
No longer confined by a shape predefined,
A path of one's own, uniquely designed.

So let the deans swarm, let them cast their decree,
The spirit of change, no boundary can see.
For in the face of contempt, or the grip of dismay,
Lies the power to sculpt, to mold, to sway.

In the dance of defiance, with each graceful turn,
Lessons of self, engraved and learned.
Beneath the stern gaze of those who demean,
The triumphant find shape, where none had been seen.
