In the vast expanse where whispering shadows dare not tread,
A garden of bonds grows, not fragile, but steadfast instead.
Roots intertwine, embracing each droop and lift,
In soil rich with trust, they form the most sacred gift.

With droop comes the droit, a right to stand tall,
Amongst the green, a testament to the resilience of all.
Leaves reach towards the sky, a display of ardor and might,
In their veins, the sap runs, a symbol of their fight.

Amid chaos, a whisper of order, soft and clear,
Nature's own decree, for those who choose to hear.
A symphony of existence, a delicate, balanced blend,
In the heart of the garden, where beginning meets end.

Ardor fuels the cycle, a fiery, untamed force,
Guided by order, set upon a steady course.
With droit as its companion, it carves a path so wide,
In the bonds of the earth, where all secrets reside.

"The Garden of Steadfast Bonds" this place is named,
A realm where quiet strength and beauty are proclaimed.
Here, whispers and shadows are neither missed nor yearned,
For in the light of the sun, only the true essence is learned.
