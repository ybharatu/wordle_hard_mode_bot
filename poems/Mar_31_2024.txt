In a realm where veiled nights glide,
Between the shades, lost carts abide.
Their wheels whisper tales, ancient, wide,
Of places where secrets and shadows collide.

Beneath the tawny gaze of the moon's crest,
They wander, bound on an endless quest.
Through fields of silence, they quietly jest,
Breaking the silence, a fleeting guest.

In hues of dusk, their paths unfold,
Taboo tales, in whispered voices, they told.
Of love that dares not speak, bold,
And hearts that yearn, yet remain cold.

But in their journey, there lies a charm,
A soothing balm, a healing arm.
For in the night's cool, tawny calm,
Lies a world, unharmed, a soothing balm.

So let the carts their courses plot,
Through realms of the unspoken, the unthought.
For in their glide, beauty is caught,
In the tawny twilight, peace is sought.
