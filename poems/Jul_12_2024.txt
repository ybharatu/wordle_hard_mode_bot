**A Sparkle in the Gloam**

In a dimly lit corner of forgotten streets,  
Glides a spirit on skate, an echo on beats.  
A figure from tales, in modernity's clutch,  
With a laugh in his eyes, a touch so much.

Irony's his cloak, woven tight and snug,  
In a world so serious, he's the needed hug.  
Past graffiti walls, his balance so nifty,  
Spray cans clatter down, in a moment, a jiffy.

Hippy at heart, with a soul so free,  
Fighting for peace, in a world that flees.  
His tokens of love, spread wildly, fizzy,  
A message in bottles, clear, never dizzy.

In the fabric of night, his dance lightly weaves,  
A testament to joy, in what he believes.  
This poet on wheels, in shadows, never complies,  
For in every stroke, a vivid dream lies.

So, remember the skater, when night falls timid and shy,  
For in each turn, a possibility, a new world draws nigh.  
A hippy, a painter, a dancer in life's symphony,  
Creating a world, where we all skate, in irony.
