In the vast desert, an oasis gleams,
Where alien life, like a fleeting dream,
A mirage of beauty, surreal and strange,
An image of wonder, a cosmic exchange.

The sands whisper secrets of the unknown,
Where worlds collide and mysteries are sown,
In this oasis where reality bends,
An alien image, where imagination transcends.
