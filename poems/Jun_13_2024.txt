In the heart of the night, under a sliver of moon,
Where angst quietly stitches the edges of gloom,
There's a melody playing, soft and unseen,
A symphony of shiny tunes, in a world in-between.

Shimmering notes, like stars in the sky,
Dance over the waters where forgotten dreams lie.
Each chord a beacon, in the darkness it gleams,
A lantern for the lost, in their sea of dreams.

Angst, the silent conductor, with a baton unseen,
Guides the orchestra of thoughts, in the depths of the serene.
The music, a language, where no words need speak,
Tells tales of the hopeful, the strong, and the meek.

For in each shiny note, a promise is found,
A whisper of courage, where hope is unbound.
The angst that once shackled, now sets us free,
In the tunes that glisten, we find the key.

So let the music play, let it rise, let it swell,
Across the moments of sorrow, where the shadows dwell.
For within each noteâ€™s embrace, is a light so divine,
A reminder that in darkness, there's always a sign.

A sign that amidst the tumult and the strife,
There's a melody playing, the soundtrack of life.
So hold fast to the tunes, shiny and bright,
For even in angst, there is still light.
