Beneath the cerulean expanse where dreams convene,  
A crane, of steel and might, once acted on a scene.  
It lifted burdens heavy, from dawn to set of day,  
Oblivious to whispers of time's relentless decay.  

Its hauls were like symphonies, each movement precise,  
A dance between earth and sky, valor its only vice.  
Behemoth in its glory, it reached for the unknown,  
A testament to human will, in welded steel, it shone.  

Yet, seasons turned their gaze, from warmth to bitter cold,  
The crane, once vibrant, now stood silent, tired, and old.  
Its cables, frayed; its paint, peeled by the caress of rust,  
In every groan and creak, it spoke of years, a trust.  

But let not this tale of decay bring sorrow to your heart,  
For even in silence, the crane plays an essential part.  
In its shadow, new life blooms, a sanctum of rebirth,  
Proving even in stillness, there's purpose on this Earth.  

For every structure it helped raise against the sky so wide,  
Stands as a monument to effort, to human pride.  
And though its days of lifting are long since passed and gone,  
The echoes of its legacy will, forever, haul on.
