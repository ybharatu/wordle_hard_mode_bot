In the early grasp of dawn's subtle might,
Where shadows linger in the fledgling light,
Through the alder trees, whispers softly relay
Tales of ancient times, far, far away.

These woods hold memories, in spite spiteful chill,
Of lovers' secret trysts and the wildflower's thrill.
Each tree, a silent sentinel of the past,
Bears witness to loves and enmities vast.

In the heart of the forest, time finds delay,
Echoes of footsteps, in the distance, stray.
The alder, in its wisdom, knows each story,
Of hidden glades and moments transitory.

As dawn stretches its fingers, thin and splay,
Casting gold upon paths where shadows lay,
The spiteful night retreats, and in its wake,
A world reborn, for the early risers to take.

So, let us relay, through whispers in the breeze,
Stories of the alder, meant to appease.
For in spite of darkness, or perhaps because of it,
The early light's beauty is infinitely lit.
