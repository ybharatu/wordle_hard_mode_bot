In the vast canvas of night, under a spate of stars,
There whispered a tale, across the scars,
A story woven with the threads of fate,
Bound by the moments, neither early nor late.

In fields where the golden spelt gently sways,
Secrets are cradled in the haze,
Nurtured by the earth, under the sun's fierce sores,
There blossoms a saga, between peace and wars.

Beneath the cloak of twilight, neither black nor white,
In the silence between words, where wrong leans into right,
The sores of the world, tender, raw, and ripe,
Speak of the beauty and the gory stereotype.

Yet in this spate of existence, fierce and mild,
In the heart of a tempest, or a breeze so mild,
We find the courage, weaved in nature's pelt,
To heal, to love, amidst the sores, the spate, the spelt.

A verse for tomorrow, a balm for the pain,
In every loss, there's something to gain.
In the dance of the cosmos, intricate and deft,
We are but stardust, splendid and bereft.
