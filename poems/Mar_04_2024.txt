In the realm where metal meets the flame,
An amble through shadows, not quite the same.
Whispers of echoes, a dance of light,
A waltz of contrast, a mysterious sight.

The metal sings with a clangorous tone,
As flames flicker and dance on their own.
An ethereal tango, a partnership bold,
A story untold, yet ancient and old.

As the amble continues, the fire's bright spark,
Illuminates secrets hidden in the dark.
A tale of contrasts, of heat and of cold,
In this dance of metal, flame, and untold.
