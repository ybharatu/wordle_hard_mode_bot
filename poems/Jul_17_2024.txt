**Celestial Choreography**

In the tapestry of time where manic rites unfold,
Under the watchful eyes of stars, tales ancient and bold,
There lies a waltz, utile and whispered soft,
Yet, in my promise, no whispers are aloft.

Quite unlike the dreams of yesteryears' flight,
Where shadows lurk beyond the stretch of light,
Here, in this realm, every motion sings,
Crafting destiny with invisible strings.

Manâ€™s endeavors, in their chaotic grace,
Seem but a fleeting brush in cosmic space.
Yet, every act, every try, every fall,
Is a note in the universe's enthralling call.

For what is mankind, if not dancers at heart,
Performing our part with artful art,
In the grand design, our roles we play,
Utile, in our unique and undying way.

So let us embrace our steps, however quaint,
Under the cosmos, without restraint,
Where each stride, each leap, each twirl,
Is a testament to our attempts to unfurl.

In the manic rites of human existence,
We find strength, resilience, and persistence.
Despite the chaos, there's a rhythm, quite,
In every dawn, every day, and every night.
