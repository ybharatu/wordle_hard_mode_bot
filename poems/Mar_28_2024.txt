In the quiet space where shadows dwell,
Where echoes of existence softly tell
Of ancient scripts and tales untold,
Where the daring heart turns bold.

In that moment rare and sheer,
The universe bends to lend its ear,
Listening as we shape our fate,
In whispers low, we articulate.

We speak in tongues of old and new,
Crafting worlds with a vibrant hue.
What was once a silent plea,
Now shapes the essence of you and me.

For to exist is not just to be,
But to dare, to dream, to see.
To sculpt the void with tender care,
In hopes that something breathes there.

So let us not in silence weep,
But our souls' declarations keep.
For only in our daring lies
The truth that never dies.

And thus we stand, bold and free,
Masters of our destiny.
In every word, a world takes shape,
A testament we can't escape.
