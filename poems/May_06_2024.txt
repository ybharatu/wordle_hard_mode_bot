In the quiet hum of the midnight's lab,
Where dreams are forged, and spirits jab,
Lies a tale of a future woven and grave,
Of a servo, a salve, and a close, clean shave.

---

In the realm where machines dance and thrum,
A servo stood, its purpose to become,
A guardian of times both lost and saved,
In the silent watch it bravely braved.

Within its gears, a salve did hide,
A balm for souls where secrets abide.
An elixir of hope, silently paved,
On paths where weary feet have strayed.

And in this dance of light and shadow,
A close shave from fate, narrow and shallow,
Where destinies hang by a silken thread,
A moment's hesitation, and all could be dead.

The servo, with its heart of spun gold,
Moved through the night, bold and cold.
Its mission clear, in the twilight waved,
To heal, to protect, the future it craved.

So here lies the tale, under starlit enclave,
Of a servo, a salve, and a close shave.
In the fabric of night, their stories engrave,
A whisper of life, in the silence they gave.

---

And thus, this tale spins, a spindle and loom,
In the dance of light, dispelling the gloom.
A poem of hope, in the night engraved,
Of a servo, a salve, and the ones they saved.
