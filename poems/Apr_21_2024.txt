In the heart of Coles, a jolly throng,  
Where flora dances, and hearts belong,  
Moldy whispers find no place to stay,  
For golly and holly light up the way.

Under canopies of green, in vibrant embrace,  
Laughter blooms, a contagious grace.  
Where the moldy fades into pastel hues,  
Golly, what sights! What splendid views!

Jolly moments, stitched in timeâ€™s grand loom,  
Where holly crowns gleam in twilight's gloom.  
Golly, how the merry tunes weave and thread,  
In the tapestry of joy, no tear is shed.  

Between the lines of flora, rich and wild,  
Lies the innocence of a wide-eyed child.  
Moldy shadows flee, for they fear the light,  
Of jolly days and holly nights, so bright.

Golly, oh flora, in your embrace we sing,  
Of jolly tales and laughter in the spring.  
With holly wreaths upon the door,  
Moldy gloom can reign no more.

So let the chorus rise, in fervor, and in folly,  
Among the flora, holly, jolly, and by golly,  
A symphony of life, in harmony so bold,  
Where no story of grace ever goes untold.
