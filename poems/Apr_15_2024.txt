In a slimy diner down the forgotten road,  
Lies a tale untold, of time bestowed.  
Among the greased spoons and ceramic mugs,  
Under the flickering neon, she snugly tugs  
At the heartstrings of those who dare to dine  
In the realm of the forgotten, by design.

She moves with grace amongst the grime,  
A cutie in a world out of time.  
Her laughter, a melody over clanking plates,  
A beacon of joy in a space that dictates  
A reality grim, yet she shines so bright,  
Equipped with charm, in the dimmest of light.

Not just a face, but a force, equipped  
With kindness, a gift, so eloquently scripted.  
She navigates through tables with ease,  
A sailor in storms, finding peace in the breeze.

In this diner, a world where time seems to stall,  
She reminds us that beauty can flourish in all.  
Through the slimy floors and wobbles of tables,  
In her presence, myths turn into fables.

So raise your greasy cup with a cheer,  
To the cutie who makes the gloom disappear.  
In a diner that the world forgot to equip,  
She dances in light, making hearts skip.
