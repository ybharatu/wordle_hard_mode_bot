In the quiet of dawn, where whispers birth day,  
And shadows stretch as if to find their way,  
There in the haste of moments newly born,  
Lies the echo of time, in silence, forlorn.

Within this haste, a story, rated by stars,  
A journey of epochs, in seconds that mar.  
The facet of life, a multifaceted dream,  
A crystal reflecting, in the sun's first beam.

For every facet, a myriad tales untold,  
Of hearts that beat under cloaks of bold.  
In haste, they unravel, threads golden and true,  
In the fabric of time, a tapestry's view.

Yet, rated by moments, fleeting and swift,  
Are the lives of the mortals, with spirits that lift.  
Each facet, a chapter, in the book of the soul,  
Where stories of haste, and reverence, enroll.

So gather your moments, however theyâ€™re rated,  
For within each facet, destiny's created.  
In the haste of existence, find your own pace,  
For in every moment, there's beauty to embrace.
