Beneath the realms where Hades lies,  
Darkness reigns, where no sun flies.  
From his throne of secrets untold,  
Clutches the world with talon bold.  

In the world above, where life does bloom,  
The smell of bacon fills the room.  
A simple joy, a mortal feast,  
Bridges the gap between man and beast.  

Canon of old and tales anew,  
Stories of many, believed by few.  
Each word a seed in fertile minds,  
Growing truths of countless kinds.  

Between the chasm of death and life,  
Between peace and eternal strife,  
Lies a thread, so frail, yet strong,  
Binding the right with the wrong.  

Hades watches with eyes so keen,  
Over realms seen and unseen.  
Mortal joys and tales so grand,  
All within his silent command.
