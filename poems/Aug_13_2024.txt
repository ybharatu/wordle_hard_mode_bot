In a moment's trice, under star-strewn skies,  
A reel of dreams in silver gleams, frames our sighs.  
Eking joy from the mundane, a daily rise,  
We deign to bask under the cinematic guise.  

On screens, horses neigh, tales of gallant fights,  
Where heroes grasp, in their firm clasp, for eternal rights.  
Each pilgrimage to the flickering light,  
A testament to our ceaseless plight.  

Yet in this woven tapestry of flickered tales,  
Where fantasy burgeons and reality pales,  
We find solace, bravery, in vast details,  
A shared heartbeat within cinematic veils.  

So let us journey, through realms so vast,  
Where the essence of now meets echoes of the past.  
In the quiet hall, with light cast,  
We witness life, in its boundless cast.
