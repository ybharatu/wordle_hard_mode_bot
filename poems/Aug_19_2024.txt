"In the Rhythms of Candor"

In a realm where guile shapes the contours of speech,
Where honesty's price fluctuates like rates in the reach
Of those daring to trade in the currency of truth,
There lies a path less traveled, eroded by sleuth.

Detour not deterred by the cunning or sly,
A road paved with intentions pure under the sky,
Where meter measures not just the verse or the feet,
But the heartbeat of discourse, sincere and discreet.

In dialogue, the guileless find their unique beat,
Rhythms unreckoned by deceit's swift fleet.
For in the clarity of words, devoid of any blight,
Lies the power to illuminate, far more than to incite.

So let the meter of integrity be the measure,
A treasure beyond monetary pleasure or leisure.
For in the realm of honesty, where rates may not apply,
The worth of truth remains ever high, never shy.

Here, in the open, where guile has no seat,
Conversations flourish, candid and neat.
A world envisaged by the candid, for the guide,
Where truth in its nakedness, boldly resides.
