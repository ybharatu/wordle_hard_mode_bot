In the silent juris of the forest's heart,  
where cedars stand like ancient sentinels,  
their whispers seep into the dark.  
A path unfolds, earth's hidden annals,  
where nature's law and beauty mark.  

Behold the prong of fate's own design,  
in antlers clashing 'neath canopy's sprawl,  
a dance of prowess, wild and divine,  
a testament to the wild's own call,  
where shadows merge and destinies align.  

And there, the prowlers of the night,  
with silent steps, they claim their reign,  
eyes aglow with untamed light,  
masters of the dark terrain.  
In their gaze, the forest's plight.  

So whispers wind through cedar's bough,  
a tale of power, survival's song,  
of nature's balance, fierce and proud,  
where every creature finds where they belong,  
under the watch of the twilight shroud.  

Within this realm of silent roar,  
we find our hearts, and much, much more,  
for in the wild, we can't ignore,  
the primal call, deep in our core,  
to join the dance, to explore.
