In the heart of an old, forgotten town,  
Where the shadows whisper and the streets wear a frown,  
There lies a shop, with windows dusty,  
Inside, the air is laden, somewhat musty.  

Creaking doors open to realms untold,  
Where stories of magic and mystery unfold,  
Shelves lined with wonders, in corners dimly lit,  
Among them, a jar, where metal mints sit.  

These aren't ordinary, for when they touch your tongue,  
Visions of ancient times, in your mind, are sprung,  
Tales of knights, their armors shining bright,  
Battles fierce, under the moonlight.  

But beware, for these mints do not simply refresh,  
They transport your soul, into histories mesh,  
A taste of the past, so vivid, so real,  
In the musty air, their magic you'll feel.  

So next time you wander, through streets old and bent,  
Remember the shop, and its metallic scent,  
For within its walls, time softly hints,  
At the magic and mystery, of the metal mints.
