In the heart of the urban sprawl,
Where buildings rise like giants tall,
A woman walks, her purse in hand,
Through streets where dreams and fears are fanned.

The city's pulse beats loud and strong,
A rhythm to which she belongs,
But hidden deep within her purse,
Is a secret, a flame, a subtle curse.

For in its depths, the embers burn,
A brunt of memories she must discern,
Of love lost and dreams deferred,
In this concrete jungle where truth is blurred.

So she walks on, amidst the throng,
Her purse a weight, her spirit strong,
And though the city may seem austere,
She carries her past, her future near.
