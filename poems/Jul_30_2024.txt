In a meadow where the wild things reign,
Among whispers of grass and sunlit stain,
There stands a chair, ancient, forlorn,
A silent sentinel from dusk till morn.

Mares, with manes like midnight silk,
Tread softly around, their ilk to ilk.
Their hooves, a gentle, rhythmic thud
Against the earth, rich and mud-bud.

Feral eyes, aglow with untamed fire,
Reflecting stars, and unspoken desire.
They circle the chair, a curious dance,
In this twilight realm, they prance.

No rider to claim, no burden to bear,
Just the wild and the wind, an untamed affair.
The chair remains, steadfast, alone,
In a meadow where wild seeds are sown.

The mares, they drift, like clouds at night,
Beneath the moonâ€™s soft, embracing light.
Feral hearts beat in a synchronized thrum,
In a world where the untamed roam and come.

And so they weave, a tapestry so rare,
In the world where the chair and the mares
Share a moment, a whisper of ages old,
In the story of the wild, forever told.
