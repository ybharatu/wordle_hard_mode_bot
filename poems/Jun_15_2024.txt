**The Journey Through**

Upon a road that broad did lay,
Beneath the sun's emboldened sway,
I drove through time, through night, through day,
Where dreams and destiny did fray.

Amidst a crowd of thoughts untold,
Where tales of courage, fear, unfold,
I found my spirit, stark and bold,
In stories new and memories old.

A frond, caressed by wind’s soft hand,
In nature's unmarked, vast expanse,
Whispering secrets of the land,
In its silence, I found my dance.

Proud towers rise and fall in time,
Yet, steadfast, seek the sky to climb,
Like aspirations, sublime,
In every heart, in every clime.

This journey, long, of mine, of yours,
Through open roads and unseen shores,
Leads us to our own outdoors,
To find ourselves, and maybe more.

So, drive we forth, beneath vast skies,
Beyond the where and the why,
In every hello, every goodbye,
There’s a bit of truth, a bit of lie.
