**An Ode to the Alder's Might**

In a grove where silence seldom dwells,
And the sky in whispers never tells,
There, the alder stands, in resolute might,
Against the yells of day and the blare of night.

Roots anchored deep in the earth's embrace,
Leaves dancing freely in the sun's trace,
Its branches reach out with a welcoming flare,
Defiant of the cacophony, the blare.

No whisper here, nor shadow's form,
But a fortress amidst the storm.
The yells transform to a symphony's score,
As the alder sways, steadfast evermore.

In its presence, hearts find their song,
A reminder that, though the world may be loud,
There's strength in quiet, in not belonging
To the clamor that makes us bowed.

So, let the yells come, and the blare ensue,
The alder stands, noble and true.
A testament to what we often forget,
In noise or silence, our needs are met.
