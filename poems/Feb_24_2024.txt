In the shadow of the silver moon's glow,
An actor serenades the night, a show,
Of a miner with a heart of gold,
A piper with a tale yet untold.

Amongst the crowd, a loser stands,
Yet in their eyes, courage expands,
For in their hand, a fiver gleams,
A token of hope, or so it seems.

Each one a part of life's grand play,
Each one with a role to portray,
So let us embrace, with hearts entwined,
The beauty of fate, intertwined.
