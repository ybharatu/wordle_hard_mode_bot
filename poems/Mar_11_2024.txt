In a village where whispers command the air,
And cobblestones hold stories spare,
Underneath the moon's gentle glare,
Lived the voices of democracy, fair.

A pesky wind would often dance,
Through streets narrow, in advance,
Carrying secret ballots in a wistful trance,
Urging the hearts of folk to take a chance.

Votes, like leaves, in autumn's spell,
Drifted into boxes, a silent yell.
Dreams woven in a hopeful shell,
Echoing in the bell tower's swell.

But not all voices found the light,
Some lost in the fray, out of sight,
Their hopes spare, in the perpetual night,
Yearning for a dawn bright.

And yet, this tale of times anew,
Speaks of change, in the morning dew.
For pesky struggles and victories few,
Craft a future, where every voice flew.
