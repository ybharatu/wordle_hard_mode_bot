In the market of moments where cents dangle dreams,
Alters of time shape the contours of streams.
A filet of sun slicing through grey morning clouds,
Cradling a towel that night’s darkness shrouds.

The towel, a tapestry woven with care,
Drying the oceans from those who dare
To swim in the currents of fleeting wishes,
Fishing for hope in a sea of dishes.

Cents, those soldiers of fortune and fate,
Marching in pockets, both early and late.
They jingle the anthem of labor and love,
Echoing desires to the heavens above.

Alter, the verb that commands the unseen,
Changing the hearts, painting the green
On landscapes barren yet bursting with life,
Curtailing the sorrow, the pain, and the strife.

A filet of hope on the banquet of time,
Served on a platter sublime,
Tender and rich, with a hint of desire,
Kindled in hearts, a relentless fire.

And the towel, the quiet witness to all,
Absorbing the tears that silently fall.
It dries and it warms, a comforting shawl,
In life’s vast kitchen, it stands tall.

So here in the essence of cents, alter, and filet,
Wrapped in the fibers of towels that sway,
Is life, in its beauty, a mysterious ballet,
Dancing to time, in its unique array.
