In a village, quietly sited,
Where tales of old quietly recited,
Learned men and women, wisdom ignited,
Their words in the air, lightly plighted.

By the chapel, with its gable high,
Underneath the boundless, cerulean sky,
Shared wisdom doesn’t halve but multiply,
In this truth, we find value, by and by.

To learn is not just to acquire,
But to halve our ignorance, aspire,
For knowledge's value, eternal and dire,
Lights within us, an undying fire.

From every nook, this village gives,
A lesson, a whisper, in which it lives,
To learn, to halve, to value, it bids,
In the heart of those, the future sieves.

This poem, a simple, humble weave,
Of words that breathe, think, and believe,
A tapestry of thoughts to achieve,
A moment’s peace, a reprieve.

Title: "In the Heart of the Village"
