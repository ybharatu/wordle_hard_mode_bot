In the first lanes of dawn, where light shyly creeps,
Amid whispers of dreams that the night softly keeps,
There wanders a figure, through shadows that play,
A girl named Sally, starting her day.

Sadly, she strolls with a heart heavy, laden,
Through streets that echo with the ghosts of maiden,
Her thoughts, like leaves, in the autumn breeze whirl,
Lost in a dance, a solitary girl.

But oh, how the lanes, with their promise of morn,
Whisper to Sally, in tones soft and worn,
That sorrow, though heavy and shadows, though deep,
Are but moments in time, for her heart to leap.

And there, in the first lanes, where day breaks anew,
Sally finds solace in the sky's crimson hue,
With each step, she sheds a night's melancholy,
Embracing the dawn, her spirits lifted, wholly.

So, remember the lanes, where sadly meets day,
And know that the nightâ€™s gloom shall pass away,
For in each beginning, there's strength to be found,
And in each Sally, where hope and dreams abound.
