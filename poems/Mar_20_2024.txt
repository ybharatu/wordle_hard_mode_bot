In the silence of the night, where shadows take their flight,
A peculiar dance begins, under the moon's bright grin.
Shake, the earth whispered, to the souls wrapped in mist,
A command from the depths, too fervent to resist.

Droit, the straight path, where truth and justice meet,
Where every step taken, is a heart's steady beat.
In this realm of echoes, where right battles wrong,
The spirit finds its dance, and the weak become strong.

Then came a sound, a boing, echoing through the air,
A bounce of life's ball, in this fair yet unfair lair.
It speaks of resilience, of getting up once more,
Of finding your balance, after a fall tore.

Amongst all this, a lingo, uniquely our own,
A language of glances, in every tone and moan.
It binds us together, a thread unseen,
Invisible stitches through lifeâ€™s demesne.

So here we stand, in the night's embrace,
Dancing the dance, at our unique pace.
Shaking the dust, droit in our course,
Boinging back higher, with unseen force.

Speaking in lingos, understood by hearts,
In this dance of life, where love starts.
A symphony of experiences, wild and free,
Together, in this dance, we choose to be.
