In the realm where traps lay hidden beneath,
The sulky moon, in its envy, quietly seethed.
The scoff of stars, scattered wide and far,
Jeering at the Earth, with its scars so marred.

Yet, amid the scorn, an unlikely gleam,
The shine of hope, a subtle dream.
Where darkness sought to claim its due,
A spark ignited, bright and true.

No traps could hold the light at bay,
Nor sulky shadows lead astray.
No scoff could dim what was meant to burn,
In every heart, waiting for its turn.

So let the night weave its somber tale,
Against the shine, all woes pale.
For every soul that dares to dream,
A path gleams, unseen, supreme.

The traps may lay, their jaws agape,
But light dances in every shape.
In every corner, hope does shine,
A testament, old and divine.

So scoff no more at dreams so bright,
For in the shine, lies true might.
Even sulky skies will clear,
Where there's light, there's nothing to fear.
