In a realm where time does play,  
Cults of the mind often stray,  
Not in towers of the day,  
But in hearts, they delay.

Beneath, where secrets swell,  
In corridors where truths do dwell,  
A felon, cloaked in night's own spell,  
Moves silently, his tale to tell.

He wanders past the fields so sown,  
Where melons ripe in moonlight shone,  
A feast for thoughts, for seeds once thrown,  
In the quiet earth, now fully grown.

Below the stars, yet above the fell,  
In whispers of leaves, no words to tell,  
The stories hidden, as if in a shell,  
Await the dawn to break their spell.

So here we stand, on the brink of known,  
Where the seeds of the unseen are sown,  
In the garden of night, all alone,  
We find the truths to us shown.

Within the depths of the shadowless night,  
We discover the power of inner sight,  
And in our hands, held so tight,  
The key to the wrong and right.

For in the heart of the darkest hour,  
Lies the most delicate flower,  
A truth, a love, a mighty power,  
Beneath the surface, ready to tower.
