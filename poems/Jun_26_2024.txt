In lands unseen, where dreams do roam,  
Beneath the vast, cerulean dome,  
Where gentle breezes softly tread,  
And thoughts like rivers, wide, are spread.  

There, fingers knead the earth so fine,  
Crafting beauty, line by line.  
Nature’s artisan at play,  
Molding night and sculpting day.

Among these wonders, grand, profound,  
A singular marvel is found,  
A piano, standing bold and grand,  
Its keys a bridge to a mystic land.

With every note that dances free,  
A tale unfolds of sky and sea,  
Of love that blooms and hearts that yearn,  
Of time’s relentless, ceaseless churn.

This instrument, with voice so clear,  
Transcends the now, the then, the near,  
A vessel for the soul's expanse,  
A hymn to chance, to dream, to dance.

So in these lands, where wonders knead  
The fabric of the life we lead,  
The piano's melody does prove,  
In every note, the power of love.  

Through music's grace, we understand,  
The beauty crafted by life's hand.  
In harmonies, our spirits blend,  
Till journey’s start meets journey's end.
