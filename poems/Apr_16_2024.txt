In the heart of dusk, where shadows merge and bend,
A whispering breeze carries tales, old and untamed.
Through the silence, there echoes a quiet fend,
A saga of lights and darks, so vividly framed.

Sends the night, its messengers, swift and sly,
Across vast fields, under the moon's watchful eye.
They dance between the lashes of the sleeping land,
Sowing dreams, in corners where forgotten shadows stand.

Yet, amidst this tranquil play, a stain takes hold,
A mark not of the present, but of stories untold.
It bleeds through the fabric of the night's embrace,
A reminder, a memory, that time cannot erase.

There, standing firm, a shank of olden days,
A piece of earth, untouched by time's unforgiving gaze.
It holds the secrets of the ground below,
Of battles fought and of the quiet sorrow.

In this world where sends and shades dare to entwine,
Every stain speaks of a lineage, a once proud line.
And every shank, strong against the tests of time,
Whispers of resilience, of the will to clime.

So let the night send its shadows, deep and wide,
May they carry not just stains, but stories of pride.
For within the dark, under the cloak of night's bank,
Lies the beauty of the stain and the strength of the shank.
