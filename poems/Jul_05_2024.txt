In a city's heartbeat, beneath azure skies,  
Trams line the streets, in morning's crisp sighs.  
They slide through the maze of concrete and blush,  
With the gentle allure of a quiet, hushed crush.

Passengers gather, in moments serene,  
On journeys that stitch the fabric of scene.  
The whisper of wheels, a harmonious rush,  
Paints life in the hues of an unspoken crush.

Through the windows, the world in fragments appears,  
As fleeting as memories, erasing fears.  
Each tram ride, a chapter of stories untold,  
Where glances and smiles quietly unfold.

In the dance of the day, where moments intertwine,  
The trams carry dreams along the fine line.  
Amid the city's clamor, a tranquil hush,  
Lives the beauty found in a simple crush.

So let's celebrate the paths that we cross,
In trams under skies, where no moments are lost.  
For in the heart of the hustle, away from the rush,  
Resides the tender whisper of a crisp, tram crush.
