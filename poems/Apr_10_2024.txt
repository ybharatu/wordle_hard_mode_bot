In the marrow of twilight, where whispers brew,
A pot simmers, secrets in its stew,
Under the canopy where shadows fight,
There, every smear of darkness meets the light.

Rights, forgotten, dance on the edge of a spoon,
Droits lost in the echoes of a bygone moon,
In the blend, justice and mercy softly troth,
Serving the hungry soul a bowl of warming broth.

The world, a canvas, stained by tears and mirth,
A tapestry of trials, a testament to rebirth,
Where every smear is part of a grander design,
Every heartache, a step towards something divine.

So let us sip from this communal pot,
Savoring the droits that time forgot,
In every spoonful, a story, a truth,
A broth uniting old and ever-youth.

"The Broth of Rights" they'll call this tale,
A reminder that even when the darkest smears prevail,
In the collective pot, our stories entwine,
Creating a broth that forever will shine.

Title: "The Broth of Rights"
