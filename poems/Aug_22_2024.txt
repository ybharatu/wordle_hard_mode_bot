In the heart of wilderness, under skies so wide,
Where the sun crowns the horizon, and the stars reside,
A stern tamer walks with footsteps sure and glide,
Confronting nature's brute with neither fear nor pride.

With gentle might, he speaks in tongues of old,
A dialect of patience, more precious than gold,
The beasts, they listen, their stories unfold,
In the presence of the tamer, their spirits he holds.

No chains of iron nor cages of despair,
But an unspoken bond, floating in the air,
Where respect is the currency, and trust is rare,
Between the heart of the wild and the tamer's care.

He, who once was a brute, wild and untamed,
Now stands as a guardian, his fury reclaimed,
A master of whispers, in silence, he's famed,
A whisperer of the wild, in essence, unnamed.

In the realm of the untamed, his legend grows,
A man who walks softly, where the wild river flows,
He teaches us lessons, more than he knows,
About coexistence, and the peace it bestows.

So here's to the tamer, with his stern guise,
A reminder of strength, wise beyond wise,
In a world where the brute and beauty lies,
He stands as a bridge 'neath the open skies.
