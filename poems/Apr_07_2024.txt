In the depths of the sea, where secrets dwell,  
Beneath waves that whisper and swell,  
There slumbers a treasure, not bound by chains,  
A gift from the depths, where silence reigns.

Pearls, pure and fair, birthed from pain,  
Held in the dark, 'neath the ocean's domain.  
Each orb a tale, a memory encased,  
Of time and of tears, so beautifully laced.

Tails, not of beasts, but of tales untold,  
Of mermaids, of shipwrecks, of pirates bold.  
These pearls, they are the stories, the legends alive,  
Surviving the depths, destined to thrive.

Voila! With a wave, from the seabed, they rise,  
Brought forth by the moon, under starlit skies.  
A miracle of nature, a whisper of the deep,  
Emerging from slumber, from their ancient sleep.

So when you hold a pearl, understand its lore,  
It's not just beauty that you adore.  
But stories, and secrets, and whispers of old,  
A piece of the ocean, in your hand, you hold.
