In the dusky woods where shadows play,
Amongst the boars that snort and stray,
A voice, a tenor, pure and clear,
Rises above the fear, near and dear.

It sings of lands both other and the same,
Of realms unknown, without a name.
This voice, it travels, outer bounds to breach,
In tones so rich, they silently teach.

In the quiet where wild hearts roam,
There's a melody far from home,
A song of thorns, of love, of plight,
In the breaking dawn, in the creeping night.

Here, where earth and mystery merge,
A tenor sings the wanderer's urge,
To explore the depths of the outer and more,
With the spirit of the boars, untamed at its core.

This symphony of wild and known,
Where seeds of dreams are quietly sown,
Echoes the stories, ancient and vast,
In every note, a spell is cast.

So listen close, beneath the moon's glow,
To the tenor that sings where the wild things go,
For in its chorus, both haunting and dear,
Lies the magic we've learned to fear and revere.
