In a realm where skies are woven
With threads of argon glow,
Stands a silent crane, unbroken,
Watching time’s relentless flow.

Its feathers brush the heavens,
Its eyes pierce through the dusk,
Guardian of the hidden,
A monument of trust.

The world spins, a dervish dancer,
Beneath its watchful gaze,
Its heart beats with an answer
To the sun's departing blaze.

And there, amid the shifting sands
Of dreams that dart and dodge,
Echoes the sound, profound and grand,
Of life’s resounding organ lodge.

This creature, tall and regal,
In the twilight's fading light,
Becomes a bridge, almost illegal,
Between the day and night.

It stands, a silent sentinel,
Where earth and sky conjoin,
Amid the simple, the elemental,
Its presence does anoint.

So let the darts of fortune fly,
And let the evening bring
Its tapestry from the nightly sky
Where cranes and angels sing.

In this world of constant motion,
Our spirits, high, take flight,
Inspired by such devotion,
In the shadowless night.
