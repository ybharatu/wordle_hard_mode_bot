In the heart of a city that never sleeps,  
Under the neon lights, where the night creeps,  
There exists a corner, untouched by time,  
Where asses noire prance, in rhythm, in rhyme.

The air, heavy with tales, yet to be told,  
Bebop melodies, brassy, brave, and bold,  
Decoy whispers of a world, stark and sheer,  
Where music paints colors, only the soul can hear.

Here, the past and future, in harmony, extol,  
Each note a story, each beat a soul,  
In a dance of shadows, in the absence of light,  
The night reveals its beauty, its eternal plight.

Amidst this, an art, pure, without decoy,  
Speaks of freedom, of sorrow, of joy,  
Creating amidst silence, a loud, vibrant, voice,  
An ode to existence, to making a choice.

So let's raise our glasses, to the nights we seize,  
To the music that fills us, to the moments like these,  
Where every note played, every step on the floor,  
Is a tribute to life, and so much more.
