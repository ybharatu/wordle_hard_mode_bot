In the silence of night, under an ebony sky,
A whisper through trees, a soft, lonesome cry.
Heard lines of the world, in gentle repose,
Speak of the secrets that darkness encloses.

A message carried on the wind's tender envoy,
Through fields of forgotten, where wildflowers enjoy
The touch of the moonlight, in its silvery glow,
And shadows dance quietly, in the meadow below.

Each line an echo of stories untold,
Of love that was lost, and hearts that grew cold.
Yet beneath the veneer of the night's mystery,
Lies a tapestry woven with threads of history.

So listen closely, for the night has a voice,
An ebony guise, cloaked in a choice.
To ignore the whispered lines, the tales of the past,
Or let them into your soul, knowing they'll last.

For in every shadow, and in every sigh of the breeze,
There's a story, an echo, a plea.
And the envoy of night, with its gentle caress,
Reminds us to listen, and in our hearts, confess.

To the beauty and sorrow that lives in the night,
Where ebony skies and dreams take flight.
So hear the lines spoken, let them guide your way,
Through the darkness, until the first light of day.
