In the quiet room where whispers weave,
Among the sofas where dreams conceive,
There's a silence that we hardly grasp,
A comfort in the wrinkle's clasp.

Parse the patterns of the light,
Dancing across the day and night,
Finding meaning in the soft embrace,
Of cushioned corners in a tranquil place.

In every thread, a story told,
In every dent, a memory bold,
Sofas - the silent witnesses of time,
Holding moments, both bitter and sublime.

To grasp the essence of days gone by,
In the fabric, our histories lie,
Parsed through times of joy and sorrow,
Sofas tell of our yesterdays and our tomorrow.

So let's hold close the comfort found,
In the silent stories that abound,
In every grasp, a connection deep,
Upon the sofas, where our hearts keep.
