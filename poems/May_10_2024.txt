In the realm where words and worlds collide,
Under the watch of the ever-gleaming tide,
There dwells a truth, both shiny and wide,
A beacon for the restless, a place to confide.

Whispers echo in the night, riled and raw,
Spirits of media, unchained, abhor the law.
They dance and weave through digital thread,
Crafting tales from the things left unsaid.

In the glow of screens, our minds take flight,
On wings of information, through the boundless night.
Yet beneath the sheen, shadows stir, contrive,
Questioning the lore that keeps our dreams alive.

This symphony of chaos, a reflection pure,
Mirrors our essence, our thoughts unsure.
In the shiny aisles of data, riled souls seek peace,
Among the streams of media, may our wonder never cease.
