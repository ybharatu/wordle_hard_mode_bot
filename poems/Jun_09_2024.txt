In the realm where monde spins, under skies,  
Between the lines of life’s unwritten codes,  
There, the essence of existence never hides,  
In drops of time, destiny gently prods.  

Amidst the vast, unrestrained and broad  
Expanse of dreams, where thoughts like rivers flow,  
Each soul, a story, silently implored,  
For understanding in the crowd, aglow.  

This congregation, vast as sea’s own tide,  
Where every wave a different tale bespeaks,  
In their communion, differences aside,  
Finds strength in unity that each one seeks.  

Not just a fleeting moment, nor a pause,  
But life’s continuum, in which we drown,  
Together sailing, without fear or cause,  
In drops of moments, our existence crowned.  

So let the monde gaze upon this scene,  
A tapeassage of unity, unfeigned,  
In every drop, the echo of a dream,  
In every crowd, a world to be regained.
