In lands where giants once tried,  
Beneath the blue, vast, outer sky,  
There stands a tower, old and wide,  
A silent witness to days gone by.  

Its bricks, kissed by time's ether,  
Hold stories of love, loss, and tears,  
A monument, relentless, neither  
Swallowed by time nor faded sears.  

Within its heart, a secret keeps,  
A door locked to the unknown,  
Where the echo of eternity sleeps,  
In halls where light has rarely shone.  

And so adventurers, brave and bold,  
Seeking the tales untold,  
Venture into the embrace old,  
Where mysteries and dreams unfold.  

For in the fabric of the night,  
Woven with stars and the moon's light,  
Lies the truth beyond our sight,  
In the ether, out of time, out of plight.  

So let us journey beyond the seams  
Of reality, into the dreams,  
Where every truth finally gleams,  
In the vast, where the future deems.
