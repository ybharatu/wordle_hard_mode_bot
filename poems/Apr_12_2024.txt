Beneath the sweet rowan's gentle shade,  
Where whispers of ancient lore are laid,  
There danced the wind with a whiny tune,  
Under the watchful gaze of the silver moon.  

The rowan, keeper of secrets old,  
With berries red and leaves of gold,  
Stood solemn in the evening's glow,  
Guarding stories only it could know.  

A melody of nature, whiny and sweet,  
Played on repeat where earth and sky meet,  
Telling tales of love, loss, and rebirth,  
Of the endless cycles of our dear earth.  

The sweet rowan, in its steadfast row,  
Witness to what the winds bestow,  
Listens to the whiny song of night,  
Bearing witness to the moon's soft light.  

In the symphony of the cosmos grand,  
The rowan plays its part, silent and grand,  
A beacon for those who walk the night,  
Guided by its boughs of gentle light.  

So under the sweet rowan we come to rest,  
With tales of the whiny wind confessed,  
In the silence, our souls intertwine,  
With the sweet rowan, eternal and divine.
