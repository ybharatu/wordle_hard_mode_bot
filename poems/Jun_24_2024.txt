In the realm of hushed fascinations,  
A place beyond the crest of mundane horizons,  
Spoke the legend of Moran, bold and free,  
With godly whispers, he sculpted destiny.

Not with shadows lurking behind,  
Nor with whispered secrets entwined,  
But with a vigor so profoundly clear,  
Echoing through the mountains, dear.

In his grasp, a dolly, carved from dreams,  
A silent companion, or so it seems,  
Woven from the threads of twilight's embrace,  
Bearing the history of a forgotten grace.

Moran, with his godly muse,  
Set forth a path with no refuse,  
Guiding the stars back to their dome,  
With the dolly, his celestial tome.

Through valleys deep and mountains high,  
Their spirits danced beneath the sky,  
A testament to what one can invoke,  
With courage, at the heart of the words spoke.

In every fiber, a universe spun,  
A tale of unity, brightly won,  
Moran and his dolly, in timeless flight,  
A beacon of creation, in the night.
