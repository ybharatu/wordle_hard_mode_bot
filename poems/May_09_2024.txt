In a world where whimsy flew and soared,
Lived a fairy, awkward and adored.
She wasn't graceful, or lithe, or perky,
Her flight, at best, was kind of jerky.

With wings that sputtered in the light,
She'd bump into stars, lost in the night.
Her friends would giggle, but all in fun,
For she had a warmth like the sun.

This dorky fairy, with her quirky charm,
Had a magic touch and a disarm.
She'd craft from stardust and from dreams,
A world where nothing was as it seems.

In her realm, where odd was the norm,
She'd dance in the rain, outside of the storm.
With a laugh that echoed through the sky,
She proved there's beauty in not being shy.

So here's to the fairy, unique and quirky,
Whose journey was interesting, albeit jerky.
She showed us all that what makes us dorky,
Is what makes us special, truly sparkly.
