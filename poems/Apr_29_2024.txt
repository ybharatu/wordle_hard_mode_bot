Beneath the weary sky, where dreams do sigh,
A tired soul drifts by, with a snort not quite shy.
In the fabric of the night, under the moon's soft light,
Lies a tale of graft, where hearts shift and drift apart.

With hands both rough and tender, a life they sought to render,
Mixing sweat with the dirt, in a world oft so curt.
The craft they chose to follow, through valleys deep and hollow,
Was more than mere survival, but a quest for something vital.

In the silence of their toil, beneath the stars' loyal coil,
They wove together dreams, in the seams of moonbeams.
Their eyes, though laden with stories untold,
Glimmered with the magic, of the futures they'd hold.

So here's to the ones beneath the night sky wide,
Who hold fast to their craft, with pride in each stride.
For in every drop of sweat, and each tired, weary snort,
Lies a universe of dreams, in the worlds they've wrought.
