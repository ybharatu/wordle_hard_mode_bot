In the realm of love, a swain did dwell,
His heart so tender, his tale to tell.
But spiteful words from a bitter foe,
Threatened to crush his spirit low.

A blacksmith by trade, with strength unfurled,
Forged words of hate that quickly swirled.
Yet the swain, with resolve so strong,
Turned the spite into a melodic song.

He rose above the smith's cruel hand,
With grace and poise, he took a stand.
For in his heart, love did reside,
And in the end, true love defied.

So let this tale of love and strife,
Remind us all of the beauty in life.
For even in the face of hate's cruel myth,
Love conquers all, as forged by the smith.
