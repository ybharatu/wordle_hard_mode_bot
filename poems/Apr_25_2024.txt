In the liminal glow of dusk's embrace,
Where whispers thread through the spaces in-between,
A tale unfolds, an intro with no trace,
Of grand conclusions yet unseen.

Under a sky painted with twilight's ink,
Ere the night devours the day's last gleam,
We find ourselves on the precipice's brink,
Where realities blur into dream.

"Still eatin'," says the earth to the falling rain,
As seeds awaken beneath her skin,
A testament to nature's simple refrain,
In cycles unbroken, life begins again.

The stars, like spectators, calmly oversee,
This dance of existence, quiet and profound,
Where every creature, every leaf, every tree,
Sways to the rhythm of a universe unbound.

So, let us then, under this cosmic dome,
Feast on moments, on whispers fair and bright,
For in this intro, this temporal home,
We are all still eatin', bathed in fading light.
