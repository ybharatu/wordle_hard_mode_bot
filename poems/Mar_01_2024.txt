In a bustling court where shadows dance,
Beans scattered, worth not a second glance.
Forty whispers carried on the breeze,
Tales of love and loss, of highs and deeps.

Each bean a story, a secret to share,
In this place of beauty, beyond compare.
Court of dreams where hopes take flight,
Forty wishes shimmering in the night.

In this realm of magic and worth untold,
Where secrets lie hidden, waiting to unfold.
A tapestry of beans in colors bright,
In this court where dreams ignite.
