Beneath the vast expanse of blue,
Where dreams find hue and hearts renew,
An ancient tale of time unfolds,
In whispers soft and shadows bold.

It helps, they say, to find your path,
Beyond the aftermath of wrath,
Where peace lies hidden, quietly,
In nature's cradle, by the sea.

The train of life, it chugs along,
Past right and wrong, the weak and strong,
Through tunnels dark and mountains grand,
Towards a fate not yet unplanned.

And there, a frond, in verdant grace,
Unfurls in space, its delicate lace,
A symbol of endurance, pure,
In world chaotic, yet demure.

It whispers tales of storms it braved,
Of sunlight saved, and nights enslaved,
Each vein a story, line by line,
Of life's design, both harsh and fine.

So, let us take this lesson, dear,
From nature's seer, both far and near,
In helps and trains, in fronds and sea,
There lies a truth, a key, to be.

The journey's hard, the path is wide,
With faith our guide and hope our stride,
We'll navigate the life we're spawned,
With courage drawn, like that of frond.
