In the realm where dreams weave through the hours,
A place untouched by faire's enchanting powers,
There dwelled a louse, so cunning and keen,
Amongst the ounces of gold unseen.

This louse, no common pest, but a thief of time,
Danced through pastries, a crime so sublime.
An ounce of wisdom, it sought to steal,
From the hearts of dreamers, to break, to heal.

In moonlit dances, without a whisper or shadow,
It moved with grace, through fields fallow.
An ounce of courage, from the lion's mane,
It took with ease, and without shame.

The faire, once vibrant, now silent and still,
As the louse wove magic, against every will.
An ounce of joy, it yearned to claim,
Leaving behind, just echoes of name.

Yet in this tale, where darkness seems to win,
A flicker of hope, grows from within.
For every ounce of sorrow, a lesson it bore,
Teaching that light, dwells in the core.

So let not the louse, nor the absence of sound,
Dim the beauty, that in life is found.
An ounce of love, of faith, unbound,
In the faire of life, is where they're found.

And thus, the tale, a cycle, a circle, a round,
In the search for what's lost, there's much to be found.
For in every louse, lies a story untold,
Of ounces of dreams, more precious than gold.
