In the heart of an unseen forge, beneath the sun's judgment gaze,
Where hours meld with metal, and the night meets the day,
Lies a craftsman's quiet kingdom, with an anvil as his throne,
His subjects wrought from iron, in a court of wood and stone.

With every strike upon the anvil, a story begins to say,
Of battles fierce and love’s soft touch, in a world far away,
His nails, not just of keratin, but of steel, so finely laid,
Bind together fragments, of dreams that never fade.

In the warmth of glowing embers, a petri dish of life,
Where elements dance freely, in harmony and strife,
The craftsman nurtures beauty, with hands both firm and kind,
Inlays of gold and silver in the darkness, he does find.

These nails do not pierce flesh, but rather, piece the sky,
Crafting constellations, in the canvas way up high,
With each hammer’s fall, a star is born, so bright, so vast, so still,
In the quiet of the forge, the universe bends to his will.

So let us marvel at the craftsmanship, of worlds both big and small,
From the intricate design of life, to the grandeur of it all.
For in the heart of every creation, whether grand or something frail,
Lies the echo of the anvil, the petri dish, and the nail.
