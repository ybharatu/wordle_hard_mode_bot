In the stillness of night's embrace,
Where shadows stretch and touch the base
Of dreams where weary hearts reside,
A tired soul seeks to hide.

Through mazes of the mind, it wraps,
In silken threads that time elapses,
A journey's force, with gentle hands,
Guides the lost to understand.

Mercy, like a whispered breeze,
In moonlit dances 'tween the trees,
Breathes life into the aching parts,
Mending what was broken, starts.

So, wrapped in blankets of the night,
The tired ones find their plight,
Met with force, yet gentle, see,
Mercy's touch sets them free.

Together in the darkness, cope,
Threads of mercy, strands of hope,
In the weave of night and force,
Find their ever-guiding course.
