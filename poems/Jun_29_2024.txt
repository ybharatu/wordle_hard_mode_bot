In a world woven from the fabric of dreams,  
Where zebras gallop under sunbeams,  
Dancing in meadows, wild and free,  
Their stripes a testament to nature's decree.

In this land, where fantasy breeds,  
A baker toils, fulfilling needs,  
His hands craft more than mere bread,  
But golden loaves of hope, widespread.

No whisper of doubt, no shadow falls  
Upon this realm where wonder calls.  
The chosen path, less traveled, yet dear,  
Leads to a place where joy is clear.

The bread, a symbol, sustenance, and art,  
Melding the worlds of man apart.   
With every choosen piece, a story's fed,  
Of unity, peace, and hearts that led.

Together, under the expansive azure sky,  
Bound by the heart, where dreams never die.  
The zebra, the baker, and their improbable thread,  
In a tapestry of life, beautifully spread.
