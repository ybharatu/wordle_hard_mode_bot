In the wards where shadows whisper tales,
Under the moon's silent, watchful eye,
There lies a path, subtle and frail,
Where fantasies sleep and truths say goodbye.

Within these halls, old stories conte,
Of heroes bold, and lovers torn apart,
Each step a verse, each breath a note,
In the endless symphony of the heart.

Yet, amidst the echoes of past glory,
A solitary figure dares to climb,
With hands of hope, crafting their story,
Against the relentless decay of time.

Upwards they reach, with determination,
Past fears that shackle, and doubts that blind,
Seeking the summit of their own creation,
A place where peace and purpose intertwine.

So let us wander, and let us dream,
Beyond the confines of our known scope,
For within us all, there gleams a beam,
Of a future ripe with untold hope.
