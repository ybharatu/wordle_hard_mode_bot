**In the Light of Contrasts**

In the heart of a brute, kindness sleeps like a saint unseen,  
Where darkness dwells, a shaft of light pierces through,  
Illuminating the intertwining of might and gentle dreams,  
Revealing within the beast a pure, celestial hue.

Not by the force of fists, but by the strength of spirit,  
The brute embarks on a journey to transcend,  
With each step, the saint within starts to inherit  
The essence of love, a power that can mend.

Through the shaft, a spectrum of hope disseminates,  
Touching souls entangled in their own wars,  
A reminder that even the fiercest heart contemplates  
The tranquil truce under the same serene stars.

In this realm where both extremes coexist,  
We learn that within us lies a similar mix,  
The brute and the saint, in a delicate twist,  
Navigating life's trials with courage and wits.

So let us embrace the complexity of our nature,  
The brutal force and the saintly nurture,  
For it is through this balance that we mature,  
Finding harmony in our unique stature.
