In a distant corner where the kilns blaze,
Forging dreams in their fiery gaze,
Under the stern and watchful eye of night,
Where stars blink in silent delight.

Here, the levin, in its rampant dance,
Illuminates the skies with every chance,
A fleeting glimpse of nature's power,
In the tumult of the midnight hour.

Beneath the forge, the anvil stands proud,
Echoing the craftsman's oath aloud,
A testament to creation's enduring call,
Where sparks fly and hammer falls.

In this realm, where elements conspire,
To mold and shape, to lift higher,
The essence of creation finds its form,
In the kiln's heat, through the storm.

A symphony of fire, metal, and might,
Under the cloak of the endless night,
Where every blow and every flame,
Tells a story, whispers a name.

This is the place where worlds are wrought,
With hands of steel and threads of thought,
A crucible where the heart and the anvil meet,
Where the journey's long, but the end is sweet.

"The Anvil's Symphony"
