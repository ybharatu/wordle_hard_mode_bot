In the garden of time, where moments wander free,
A sahib amidst the green, beheld what none could see.
A loner by choice, in solace he'd deter,
From crowds that fevered pitch, his quietude to stir.

No ailment to his essence, nor malady to refer,
His solitude, a fortress, none dared to conquer.
Through seasons’ endless cycle, beneath the sun’s fervor,
He learned the art of being, a silent observer.

In the language of the breeze, and in the dance of a leaf,
He found profound conversations, in silence, a relief.
No more a stranger to himself, within his soul, a clear belief,
In the company of his shadow, he found his peace, brief.

So here's to the sahib, a loner at heart’s core,
Who found within life’s vastness, a way to softly roar.
In the stillness of his being, he discovered much more
Than in the clamor of the world, where spirits often wore.
