In the shadows of whispers, under a moon so vivid,  
Lords lived lucid in realms splendidly vivid.  
They danced with dreams on the edges of night,  
Where stars sang softly, granting visions bright.

In awe, the foliage bowed under their gaze,  
Grass glistened like emeralds in the sun’s blaze.  
With every step, they wove destinies unknown,  
In the tapestry of time, their legacies shown.

Their laughter, a melody in the ether’s embrace,  
Echoed through valleys, a timeless grace.  
Eyes alight with the wisdom of ages past,  
Their presence ephemeral, too wondrous to last.

Yet, in the heart of the forest where silence reigned,  
Their essence lingered, in the arcane contained.  
For those who tread softly, respect in their hearts,  
Could feel the magic, of the lords’ lost arts.

So listen, dear traveler, to the wind’s soft whispers,  
For it carries tales of those luminous register.  
Lords that lived lucid, in legends now sleep,  
In dreams, they beckon, in your soul to leap.
