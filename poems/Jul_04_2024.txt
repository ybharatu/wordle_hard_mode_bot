Beneath the silver arch of day's debut,
Where mornings alter light with subtle hand,
We stand to greet the world, our debts in view,
The tally of our hopes, our dreams so grand.

With every shove against time's steady gate,
We mark our passage, raw and unrefined,
Debut our hearts to fate, and thus create
A trail of light for those we leave behind.

For life, a ledger vast, demands its due,
Each debit carved with lessons hard and true,
Yet through the balance, courage takes its cue,
To find in change a path forever new.

So let us then with steadfast purpose meet,
Each alter, shove, and ledger incomplete.
