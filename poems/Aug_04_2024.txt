In the grasp of dusk, where sunlight dares to stare,
A canvas stretches, bold and bare,
Where every line maps out a tale
Of time's relentless, forward sail.

Beneath the boughs of aging oak,
Stands a figure, cloaked in time's smoke,
An older soul with eyes like ember,
Guarding dreams too fragile to remember.

This loner walks the path of twilight,
Where stars wink at the coming night,
A silent guardian of the silvered hour,
Watching seasons turn, sweet and sour.

Beside the stream, under the moon's gentle cover,
Whispers the heart of an unseen lover,
Tending to wounds with time's slow balm,
Seeking solace in night's cool, calm.

With every step, the world seems lower,
Echoing the weight of shoulders grown older,
Yet, in the quiet, there blooms a flower,
A testament to love's enduring power.

From dusk till dawn, through time's great sweep,
This dance of light and darkness, deep,
In every heart that dares to dream,
Flows the silent, eternal stream.
