In a noble realm of grace and might,  
Where kings and queens reside in light,  
A spate of emotions stirred the air,  
As skaters glided without a care.  

Each state of being, a delicate dance,  
Balancing on the edge of chance,  
With every raise and fall in fate,  
They carved their stories on the slate.  

In the grand design of time and place,  
They found solace in the endless race,  
Where noble hearts forever skate,  
In the symphony of their chosen state.
