In a world where kindness was merely a whisper,
A realm where grudges and harshness would wither,
There lived a soul, far nicer than most,
Spreading warmth, in the chill they'd host.

Through their life, they walked with grace,
Offering lifts, in life's relentless race.
With every step, hearts would ascend,
In their presence, broken spirits would mend.

And like the moon, so silent and bold,
Their kindness was a sight to behold.
It tugged at the seas of human emotion,
Stirring within, a deep, tidal motion.

For in their acts, both big and small,
Lay a power, mighty and tall.
A gentle force, yet fiercely true,
Changing the world, with the kindness they knew.

So, let us learn, from their silent decree,
To lift as we climb, to set our spirits free.
In the tide of life, be the calm, be the guide,
For in lifting others, we ourselves, truly abide.
