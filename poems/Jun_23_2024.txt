In a town not written on any map,  
Lived Liber, a bloke with not one cap.  
With every sunrise, greeted by a bugle's blare,  
He danced through life with a rarely seen flair.

His steps, unwritten sonnets on the cobblestone street,  
A rhythm, a rhyme, a bass for his heartbeat.  
No ordinary tune could lead such a dance,  
But the bugle's call gave him that chance.

The notes played on, through joy and through strife,  
The soundtrack to Liber's extraordinary life.  
Each hornblast a reminder of days swift fleeting,  
A call to cherish each moment, each meeting.

So here’s to the bloke who lived by the song,  
Whose days were bright, his spirit strong.  
Though the bugle’s echo may fade into night,  
Liber’s dance continues, in the dawn's gentle light.

Title: "The March of Time"
