In the gallery of existence, where kinds are many and diverse,  
Each soul, a painting, with fates that intertwine and disperse.  
Under the canopy of stars, we roam with dreams as our guide,  
Holding onto memories like leaves in the autumn, side by side.

Once, in the valley where shadows mingle with light,  
I met a spirit, dancing, blending day with night.  
He wore the universe around his waist so tight,  
A belt of galaxies, in the darkness, a stunning sight.

His hands were artists, crafting destinies with care,  
On one wrist, a compass, on the other, open air.  
He whispered of freedom, in the crisp, cool, evening breeze,  
And how he'd foist upon the clouds his silent pleas.

With stipe in hand, he painted on the canopy of dusk,  
A tale of time, in strokes of gold and musk.  
He sculpted dreams from the fabric of the night,  
Weaving hope and fear, in a tapestry of light.

So, remember this wanderer, with the universe at his waist,  
The architect of dreams, whose creations we've all chased.  
In the grand design of life, where each story intertwines,  
Find your rhythm, dance your dance, embrace what destiny assigns.

For in the end, we are all artists, painting with the colors of our soul,  
On the canvas of the cosmos, making the broken beautiful and whole.  
Let the music of the spheres guide your wrist, gentle and brisk,  
For in every moment of creation, lies an opportunity, an artistic risk.
