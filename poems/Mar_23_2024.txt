In the depth of a forest, dense and green,
A sloth clung to dreams, in a world unseen.
It dared the sun to set, the moon to rise,
With slow, thoughtful eyes, wise beyond lies.

The miser, with pockets deep and heart so tight,
Counted coins under the cold, starless night.
He hoarded time like gold, a precious prize,
Yet in his chest, a barren heart did rise.

And from this earth, a spirit awakened anew,
Risen from the dust, into skies so blue.
It whispered of the treasures, not of gold,
But of stories untold, and courage bold.

The sloth, the miser, their paths intertwined,
One lived in shadows, the other, confined.
Yet both, in their essence, sought the light,
A journey from the dark, into the plight.

So here's the tale of dares and dreams so sheer,
Of breaking free from the shackles of fear.
Where the miser learns to give, to feel the sun,
And the sloth, in its patience, finds the run.

For in every soul, a universe vast and wide,
With stars and stories, hidden deep inside.
To rise, to dare, to dream, to finally see,
That in the heart's quiet, lies the key.
