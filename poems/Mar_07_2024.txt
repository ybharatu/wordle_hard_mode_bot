Beneath the coat of the night, veiled in its pause noire,
A breath held tight, stars' crib, in cosmos' drawer.
Echoes dance in the silence, footsteps of the lore,
Shadows merge, in clandestine embrace, forevermore.

In the depth of the void, where dreams are sown,
A figure lurks, not alone, but a silhouette cloned.
Mirrored motions in the dark, a duplicity condoned,
Two hearts beat as one, in the expanse unowned.

They move through the ether, a ballet of the lost,
Each step, each gesture, a line that they have crossed.
Not bound by the flesh, nor by fortunes tossed,
In this realm of pause noire, their paths are glossed.

A dance of echoes, in the silence that they stole,
A clone not of flesh, but of a fragmented soul.
Here in the pause, they find their role,
In the night's embrace, they become whole.

This tale spun from the night, where shadows play and roam,
Speaks of the clone, of the pause, in the universe's tome.
A poem, a whisper, in the cosmic dome,
Where the pause noire holds the throne.
