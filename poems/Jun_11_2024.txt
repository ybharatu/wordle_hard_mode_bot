In parks where dreams are softly sown,
Beneath the skies with sunlight blown,
A momentary glance is flung,
As carelessly as songs are sung.

With feet on pathways made of stone,
Past monuments and realms unknown,
Each step a tale that's yet untold,
A tapestry of life unfolds.

Slung across this vast expense,
A tapestry of past tense,
Where nature's hand has gently swung,
The pendulum, since time was young.

Here, among these ageless tracts,
The earth beneath our feet impacts,
The essence of our transient throes,
Among the whispering winds that blow.

But let the winds not speak today,
Of shadows deep or disarray,
But rather of the moments found,
In every leaf, in every mound.

For in these parks, we see the trace,
Of life's relentless, vibrant race,
Where stone and leaf and sky converge,
And silent stories, whispers surge.

Yet in my verse, no whispers play,
No shadow falls across our way,
Only the light, in its purest form,
Revealing where our hearts grow warm.

So let us walk, and let us see,
How simple, splendid life can be,
When stone and verdure softly blend,
And to the soul, their grace they lend.
