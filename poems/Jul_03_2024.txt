In lands far where the green hills sigh,
And the blue heavens kiss the rye,
There came about a curious tale,
Of swine, a trial, in detail.

Within a field where thistles thrive,
The swines, in mud, felt most alive.
Their thick thighs buried in the earth,
Reveling in mirthful girth.

But fate had spun a twisted thread,
A trial loomed, heavy as lead.
For in their bliss, they'd crossed a line,
Now stood accused, those hefty swine.

No whisper of guilt, in their eyes,
Only the truth, under the skies.
With each plea, their innocence cried,
Nature, their judge, would not be defied.

The sun bore down, the verdict clear,
In nature's court, there's naught to fear.
Their trial, but a moment's plight,
Freed they roamed, into the light.

So let this tale of swine remind,
In every creature, truth we find.
Their thick thighs a symbol, strong,
In nature's court, we all belong.
