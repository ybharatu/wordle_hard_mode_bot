Beneath the Velvet Sky

In the vast gallery of the night,
Where stars stage their silent ballet,
A comet makes its cameo flight,
Drawing eyes and hearts far away.

Its tail, a painter's final stroke
Across the dark, infinite canvas,
Whispers of mysteries it evoked,
In the silent dialogue, so gracious.

Mercy, in its purest form, descends
With every tear the comet weeps,
Its journey, an ode that never ends,
A promise the universe keeps.

For in its fleeting, brilliant glow,
A reminder of our transient light,
In the grand performance, we all know,
We are but cameos in the night.

So let us shine with all our might,
In the time we're given to play our part,
With love, with joy, with warmth so bright,
Carving our cameos in the heart of the dark.
