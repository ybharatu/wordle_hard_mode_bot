In chambers quiet, beneath the glare
Of stars that watch and gleam, and dare,
The cribs do rock with breaths so light,
In shadows cast by the pallid night.

Eyes wide open, yet seem to stare
Into the void, or perhaps they glare
At dreams unseen, at tales untold,
In the heart of night, so stark and bold.

The world outside seems far and bleak,
Yet within these walls, the whispers speak
Of hopes and fears in a gentle arc,
A contrast stark against the dark.

The crib, a vessel of dreams to weave,
Of magical journeys, we believe.
In its embrace, the innocent lie,
Under the watch of the starlit sky.

And so they slumber, with gaze so stark,
In rooms where light and shadow embark
On tales of wonder, silent and deep,
Where the crib's promise forever keeps.
