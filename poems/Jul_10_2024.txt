In a world where the old becomes new,  
We find our strength, our resolve to reuse,  
A cycle unbroken, a tale spun tight,  
In the echo of day, in the grasp of night.

Numbers whisper secrets, a sacred count,  
Under the moon's gaze, by the old fountain mount,  
A challenge not spoken, yet clearly felt,  
In the fabric of time, in the ice that melts.

Daunt not, brave soul, in the face of the gaunt,  
For within these spaces, our fears we confront,  
A landscape so barren, yet life finds a way,  
In the warmth of the sun, in the night's soft sway.

Gaunt faces of buildings, of trees, and of men,  
Hold stories untold, in the silence, then,  
A resilience blooms, in the heart of the fight,  
In the smallest of seeds, in the depth of the night.

So, let us tread lightly on this earth we share,  
With a mind to preserve, a heart to care,  
For in every ending, the start of anew,  
In the cycle of life, in the morning dew.
