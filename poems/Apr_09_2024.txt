In the navel of existence where dark and light merge,
Where shadows whisper in terms incomprehensibly diverse,
There we find ourselves, lost amidst the surge
Of life's chaos, yet silently we traverse.

With terms set by the unseen hands of fate,
We navigate through the alleyways of destiny,
Seeking the mercy that might alleviate
The burdens we bear, in solemn testimony.

In the tapestry where these threads intertwine,
Our paths converge, then again diverge,
In this dance, chaotic yet somehow divine,
We seek understanding, an end to the scourge.

Mercy, we find, not in grandiose gestures grand,
But in the quiet moments when hands reach out,
In crossing the abyss, standing on a strand,
Discovering what this journey is all about.

So let us merge our solitary ways,
Under the canopy of the cosmos' gaze,
In terms of love, let our differences dissolve,
Embracing mercy, into better selves, we evolve.

Thus, in the navel of existence, we spin,
Within this vast, unfolding cosmic hymn,
Bound by terms of a contract tacitly signed,
In the pursuit of the mercy, we're destined to find.
