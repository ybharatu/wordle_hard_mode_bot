In the cline of existence, where shadows flirt with light,
A tonic brewed from the essence of night.
Under the swaying branches, a finch's song does spin,
A melody so enchanting, a symphony of the wind.

The cline, a gentle slope of life's undying hill,
Where dreams are sowed with the softest will.
The tonic, an elixir, in lifeâ€™s cruel dance,
A sip that gives the heart another chance.

And the finch, oh the finch, in its fleeting flight,
Drapes the world in wonder, turns gloom to delight.
A feathered poet, amidst the green's embrace,
Weaving songs of joy, in this vast, endless space.

Together, these words, a tapestry do weave,
A story of hope that prompts the soul to believe.
For in this cline of existence, with every tonic sipped,
And every note from the finch, heartedly gripped,

We find the beauty that life so freely gives,
In every moment, in every breath that lives.
So listen to the finch, let the tonic heal,
Embrace life's cline, and deeply feel.
