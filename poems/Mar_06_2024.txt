In fields of roses, trade is made,
Petals soft and hues cascade,
Each bloom hides a teary tale,
Of love lost in the floral vale.

The scent of sorrow lingers there,
Amidst the beauty, hearts laid bare,
Whispers of a love forsaken,
In the petals, hearts awaken.

Trade of roses, teary sweet,
Memories that hearts repeat,
In every bloom a story told,
Of love's embrace, and days of old.
