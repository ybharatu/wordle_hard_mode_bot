In the heart of night, where shadows merge with dark,
Upon the decks of dreams, we embark.
Eyes, like sentinels, in silence stare,
Gazing through the cosmos, stripping it bare.

The moon, a beacon in the celestial sea,
Illuminates the path for you and me.
Through the tapestry of night, we gently weave,
Between the stitches of reality, we believe.

A laser, sharp and clear, cuts through the din,
A line of light, where endings begin.
It draws across the heavens, in its flight,
A bridge of beams, in the abyss of night.

We dance upon the edges of our fears,
Guided by the light, as dawn nears.
In this realm, where dreams and darkness blend,
Our spirits soar, on journeys without end.

The decks beneath our feet, a stage grand,
For the story of the universe, unfurled and planned.
We stare into the void, where mysteries unfurl,
Within this cosmic dance, our souls swirl.

So here we stand, where night meets day,
In this space, where silent sentinels play.
With every laser's beam, our dreams align,
Across the decks of time, our lights entwine.
