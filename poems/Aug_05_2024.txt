Beneath the azure dome where dreams ensue,
Where sunlight in its golden splendor shone,
Our steps, in tandem, past the morning dew,
Over the ancient, whispering stones we've known.

In mosaics where the world's tales parse,
Each tile, a fragment of the vast unknown,
Captured in the artistry, vibrant and sparse,
A story of the earth, wind, and stone.

Yet, in this path where history's feet tread,
Each fragment, underfoot, a beacon bright,
Guiding us where countless souls have led,
Through the silent watch of day and night.

In the shimmering heat or moon's pale glow,
Amidst the tiles where lost secrets lie,
Our journey, a tapestry, begins to grow,
Beneath the ever watchful eye of the sky.

So let us walk where ancient tiles have shone,
In every step, a legacy ensues,
Binding us to this earth, to flesh and bone,
A path eternal, ever old, ever new.
