Under the fiery blanket of the African sun,  
Lies a tale, unfolded, never done.  
A short hyena, laughter echoing in the dust,  
In nature's laws, in survival's thrust.

From hence, from where the earth touches sky,  
His silhouette against the sunset, a painted sigh.  
Scavenging the savannah, a dance of fate,  
In every snicker, life's tales reverberate.

Not in shadows does he hide his mirth,  
Nor in whispers does his joy find berth.  
In the openness of the plains, under the vast dome,  
Every laugh, a story, every step, a roam.

In the circle of life, where he finds his place,  
A reminder of laughter in nature's grace.  
So next time you hear the hyena's call,  
Remember, it's the wild's laughter, encompassing all.
